Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on the similarity of their tags. The tags are created by combining the movie overview and genres, and the similarity is computed using cosine similarity on the tag vectors.
Project Overview
The project uses a dataset containing information about movies, including their ID, title, genres, and overview. It processes the data to create a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a given movie based on textual features.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each movie.
title: The title of the movie.
genres: Genres associated with the movie.
overview: A brief description of the movie.
The dataset may contain missing values, which are handled appropriately in the preprocessing steps
Preprocessing
Data Selection: The dataset is filtered to include only the relevant columns: id, title, genres, and overview.
Tag Creation: A new column tags is created by combining the overview and genres of each movie.
Data Cleanup: The genres and overview columns are dropped after creating the tags column.
Feature Extraction
The CountVectorizer from the sklearn.feature_extraction.text module is used to convert the text data in the tags column into a matrix of token counts, with a maximum of 4803 features and English stop words removed.
Similarity Computation
Cosine similarity is used to compute the similarity between the tag vectors of different movies. The cosine_similarity function from the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module is used for this purpose.
Recommendation Function
A recommendation function is defined to suggest movies based on the similarity scores:
def recommend(movie_title):
    index = new_data[new_data['title'] == movie_title].index[0]
    distances = sorted(list(enumerate(similarity[index])), reverse=True, key=lambda vector: vector[1])
    for i in distances[1:6]:  # skip the first movie as it is the same movie
        print(new_data.iloc[i[0]].title)

Saving the Model
The processed data (new_data) is saved using pickle for later use:
pickle.dump(new_data, open('movies_list.pkl', 'wb'))
